# Oh ternary operator is goated.

As an intermidiate java script developer, I have always shy away from anything that try to abstract my beginner's way of doing things in JS, Such as using fat function instead of using **function(){}**

```JS
document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", ()=>{
//  (fat funky is cool too btw)
})
```

Or Writing if statement logic on a line with note **else{}**

```JS
const cat = 44
if (cat < 5) console.log("hello reader ")
```

But i have to say ternary operator is indeed goated. and i hope i get many chance to flex use it in my code hehe.

imagine writing all of these :

```JS
const storedTask = localstorage.getItem("taskList");
if (storedTask){

}
```
